## How to Use the Conceivo 3D Integration

The Conceivo 3D Integration allows you to create and manipulate 3D models using natural language commands. Here's how to use it:

### 1. Setup

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch transformers pythreejs
```

Make sure you have the Conceivo model weights available. The integration uses `google/gemma-2b-it` by default, but you can modify this in the code.

### 2. Core Functionality

#### Initializing the Integration

```python
from gemma_3d_integration import Gemma3DIntegration

# Initialize with default Conceivo model
gemma_3d = Gemma3DIntegration()
```

#### Generating 3D Models from Natural Language

You can generate a 3D model by providing a natural language description:

```python
# Create a simple 3D model
cmd = "Create a blue cube with side length 2 units, centered at the origin. Add a red sphere of radius 1 unit above it at position (0, 1.5, 0)."

# Generate the 3D modeling code
generated_code = gemma_3d.process_3d_command(cmd)
```

This will generate Python code using Three.js via pythreejs that creates the described scene.

#### Executing Generated Code

Once you've generated the code, you can execute it:

```python
# Save the generated code to a file
with open("temp_model.py", "w") as f:
    f.write(generated_code)

# Execute the code
result = gemma_3d.execute_3d_code("temp_model.py")
```

#### Analyzing 3D Models

You can ask Conceivo to analyze or describe a 3D model:

```python
# Get analysis of a model structure
analysis_prompt = "A 3D model consisting of a blue cube with side length 2 units centered at the origin and a red sphere of radius 1 unit at position (0, 1.5, 0)."
analysis = gemma_3d.analyze_3d_model(analysis_prompt)
print(analysis)
```

### 3. Example Usage

The `gemma-3d-example.py` script demonstrates all these capabilities in action. Run it with:

```bash
python gemma-3d-example.py
```

### 4. Extending the Integration

The system is designed to be extensible. You can:
- Add support for additional 3D modeling libraries (Blender, OpenSCAD, etc.)
- Enhance the prompt templates for more specific modeling tasks
- Implement error correction and feedback mechanisms
- Add visualization output handling
