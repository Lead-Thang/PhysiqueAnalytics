# Conceivo 3D Integration

This project provides integration between the Conceivo AI assistant and 3D modeling tools, enabling natural language creation and manipulation of 3D models.

## Overview

The Conceivo 3D Integration allows users to:
- Generate 3D modeling code from natural language descriptions
- Execute generated code to create 3D models
- Analyze and describe 3D models using natural language
- Extend capabilities to various 3D modeling libraries
- Convert natural language instructions to visual 3D representations

## Components

1. **gemma_3d_integration.py**: Core integration module connecting Gemma with 3D modeling capabilities
2. **gemma-3d-example.py**: Example demonstrating how to use the integration to create a 3D scene from natural language

## Features

### Natural Language to 3D Code
The integration can interpret natural language descriptions of 3D objects and scenes, translating them into executable code for 3D modeling libraries.

### Interactive Model Analysis
Users can interactively analyze existing 3D models through natural language queries about their properties, structure, and characteristics.

### Multi-library Support
While built with pythreejs for basic functionality, the architecture supports extension to other 3D libraries including Blender, Three.js, and Unity.

## Requirements

To run this integration, you'll need:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- Gemma language model (google/gemma-2b-it or similar)
- 3D modeling libraries (pythreejs recommended for basic functionality)

## Installation

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install torch transformers pythreejs

# Clone the repository (if using in a project)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemma-3d-integration.git
```
